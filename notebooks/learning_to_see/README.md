# Learning To See

This repository contains companion code to the YouTube Series [Learning to See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8D90DkCLhI). The majority of the code for this series was developed in the jupyter notebook using [anaconda python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) 2.7. This repository includes the majority of the key code shown in the series, plus some of the code used to create animations. I'm happy to share more code upon request.
